            <u><h4>ORTHODOX SYRIAN SUNDAY SCHOOL</h4></u><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">Our Sunday school takes care of the spiritual nurturing of the children, by bringing them up in the knowledge and fellowship of Jesus Christ. The classes are conducted and the Textbooks are prepared in English. The classes which range from Preparatory to 12th are divided into four main categories. </p>
            <p justify-content="justify">1. Bethlehem (Preparatory Classes)</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">2. Nazareth (Classes1-3)</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">3. Galilee (Classes 4-10)</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">4. Tabore (Classes 11 & 12)</p><br><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The Secondary level education concludes by 10th class and a certificate is awarded, Sunday School Final Certificate (SSFC) to the successful candidates. Higher Secondary course is for another two years.</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">Children raised in this program are taught the spiritual values of Orthodoxy and the rich customs and traditions of the Indian culture.</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">Our Sunday School, equipped with the latest and best teaching aids, a sound yet flexible curriculum, and staff by qualified teachers, has the following three goals:</p><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">a. To educate our children spiritually and morally, in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ and the faith and traditions of the Malankara Orthodox Church.</p><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">b. To develop in our children the habit of attending church regularly, studying the Scriptures, and participating conscientiously in the worship and sacramental life of our church.</p><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">c. To cultivate in our children a Malankara Orthodox conscience and devotion to our ideals and to prepare them so that they become faithful and devoted dynamic members of our church, our community, and our country.</p><br><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">This ministry is to provide a broad overview of the content, history and practice of our faith. We will look at the Scriptures, and very specifically at the Gospels, as well as focus on understanding the liturgy, worship and sacramental life of the Church. We will also discuss personal spiritual disciplines, stewardship, Christian moral values, the development of the virtues and faithful living.</p><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The Sunday School curriculum is tailored to meet children's spiritual needs across various ages. For the younger children, the curriculum tends to focus on the child's individual needs and deals with Christianity in general terms. The curriculum flexes to the children's interests and desires making the learning process enjoyable and fun. For the older children, the curriculum becomes more systematic, but drives the students to voice their own thoughts and opinions. The subject matter is primarily centered on the religious traditions in the Malankara Orthodox Church, but will frequently apply religious learning to real-world situations and events. The goal for our older children is to help them apply the fundamentals of Christianity in their life journey and everyday interactions.</p><br><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">OVBS: We organise the OVBS for the children of our parish each year with many sessions of classroom learning and multiple music/drama sessions. Our children enjoy the delightful songs, some intense learning sessions and unlimited food during these days.</p><br><br>

            <u><h4>MARTHA MARIAM VANITHA SAMAJAM</h4></u><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The Martha Mariam Samajam is an organization for the women of Indian Orthodox Church. This Organization was derived to enhance and enlighten the spiritual and social growth of the women of the church. The Martha Mariam Samajam acquired its name from one of the most honored saints of our church who is St. Mary. It is said in Luke 1:28 the angel came to her and said “Peace be with you! The Lord is with you and has greatly blessed you”. Saint Mary the mother of Jesus was a woman with grace and was truly blessed to give birth to the son of God. In Luke 1:46 it says Mary said “My heard praises the Lord; my soul is glad because of God my savior….” The Women of <b> St. Gregorios Orthodox Church Mira - Bhayander</b> conduct Martha Mariam Samajam meetings after Holy Qurbana every Sunday from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. They join together in prayer, singing devotional songs, reading passages from the Bible, presentation and conduct bible classes. A subject is taken randomly from Bible and is discussed within the MMS group. There are other times when meetings and discussion are lead by our President and Vicar Fr. Geevarghese Abraham or any special guest.</p><br><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The Martha Mariam Samajam Motto: <b> “Pray, Act and Illuminate”.</b></p><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The members of the MMS are involved with many of the activities of the church.</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">• Organize Church refreshments and related activities.</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">• Pray and comfort the sick and visit those who are confined in the hospitals.</p>
            <p justify-content="justify">• Fund raising for the needy</p><br><br>
            <p justify-content="justify">The primary goal of the Samajam is the spiritual development of the women of our church through prayer. Prayer is an important aspect of our daily lives. The role of a woman is important in a family; she is an example for the other members of the family. As wives, mothers and homemakers, we must lead a life of prayer that will be beneficial to all those who come into contact with. We want to thank the Almighty God for all the women of this parish and their continuous commitment to honor this parish to the best of their abilities. May the powerful intercession of St. Mary be with us all always. All women are welcome to participate in the life of the Samajam.</p><br><br><br><br>

            <p justify-content="justify">The Orthodox Christian Youth Movement was formed in 1936 at Mavelikara under the patronage of H.H. Mar Baselios Geevarghese II. Mr. Daniel Clery (late H.G. Daniel Mar Philoxenos Metropolitan ) was appointed as the first General Secretary in 1937. In 1954, Mr. T.C. Oommen was appointed as the full time General Secretary. During this period the Annual programs called Youth Week was started. In 1957 the first Annual Conference was held at Balikamatom Thiruvalla. The Annual Conference held at Puthuppally in 1958 was a Milestone in the history of  the movement. The decisions to rename Yuvajanasamajam as Yuvajanaprasthanam and to start the publication of Orthodox Youth were taken at this meeting. The constitution of the movement was approved in the year 1962, and a Cover collection for raising fund was started along with Youth week during the same year. In May 31, 1986, the Youth Movement celebrated its Golden Jubilee. Diamond Jubilee celebrations were held at Pathanapuram in 1995. In 1999 a grand meeting called Yuvajana sangamam was held under the auspices of the Youth Movement at Kottayam.</p><br><br>

Devotional addresses, Group discussions, Bible studies, Quiz competition, Song practices etc. are the main activities of the regular meetings. Special seminars, Symposiums, Debates, Study classes and Conferences are frequently arranged by inviting eminent personalities and resource persons.
