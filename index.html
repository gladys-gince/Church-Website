    <u><h5 class="h-nary">ST. GREGORIOS OF PARUMALA</h5></u>
    <section id="parumala">
        <div class="parumala-content">
            <p>Golden and glorious chapters have been added to human history by towering personalities who swam across the currents of their contemporary world. Mar Gregorios of Parumala (1848-1902), a man who walked much ahead of his times stands out as a great luminary in the modern history of Malankara Orthodox Church. He is the only formally canonized Saint of the Church. A man of impeccable prayer life and spotless character, the Saint acquired divine wisdom and extra healing powers even when he was alive. He is held in high esteem and respect by the Christians and non Christians for his invaluable contributions as a social reformer.</p>
            <p>Living in a very conservative society of the 19th century, he raised his voice against social evils like untouchability and racial discrimination. St. Gregorios was a great visionary who very well understood the need for educating the masses. He established many schools in Kerala to eradicate illiteracy. Above all, his contributions in the literary field stand out as unique. He was the pioneer in writing the first travelogue in Malayalam. The Saint entered to his heavenly abode in 1902 and his mortal remains are entombed in Parumala, Kerala.</p>
